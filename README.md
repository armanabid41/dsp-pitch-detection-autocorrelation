# DSP Pitch Detection using Autocorrelation

This project implements frame-wise pitch detection from human speech signals using the autocorrelation method.

## Features
- Band-pass filtering (80–500 Hz)
- Frame-wise autocorrelation-based pitch detection
- Histogram-based pitch distribution analysis
- Basic voice type classification (Male/Female/Noise)

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Application
- Speech signal analysis
- DSP academic projects
