# DSP Pitch Detection using Autocorrelation

This project demonstrates frame-wise pitch detection from speech signals using classical DSP techniques.

## Features
- Band-pass filtering (80–500 Hz)
- Frame-wise autocorrelation-based pitch detection
- Histogram-based pitch distribution analysis
- Basic voice type classification (Male/Female/Noise)

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Application
- Speech signal analysis
- DSP academic projects

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
2. Place an input WAV file in the project directory
3. Update the file path in the code
4. Run the Python script to obtain pitch histogram and voice classification
