# DSP Pitch Detection using Autocorrelation

This project implements frame-wise pitch detection from human speech signals using the autocorrelation method.

## Features
- Band-pass filtering (80–500 Hz)
- Frame-wise autocorrelation-based pitch detection
- Histogram-based pitch distribution analysis
- Basic voice type classification (Male/Female/Noise)

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Application
- Speech signal analysis
- DSP academic projects

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
2. Place an input WAV file in the project directory
3. Update the file path in the code
4. Run the Python script to obtain pitch histogram and voice classification
